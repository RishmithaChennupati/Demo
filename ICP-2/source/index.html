<p> To meet the requirements of the local community, music stores established.
    Individual amateur musicians were included, as well as schools from primary through college,
    municipal bands and orchestras, churches, and entertainment ensembles that performed at community

<p> Another notable contrast in the United States and Canada is between "Band & Orchestra" stores,
